## Default scan

Regular scanning allows you to send files to the sandbox without super fine-tuning the settings.

```py title="Code example" hl_lines="17-25"
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path

from ptsandbox import Sandbox, SandboxKey
from ptsandbox.models import SandboxBaseScanTaskRequest, SandboxOptions


async def main():
    key = SandboxKey(
        name="test-key-1",
        key="<TOKEN_FROM_SANDBOX>",
        host="10.10.10.10",
    )

    sandbox = Sandbox(key)

    task = await sandbox.create_scan(
        Path("./example.py"),
        options=SandboxBaseScanTaskRequest.Options(
            sandbox=SandboxOptions(
                image_id="ubuntu-jammy-x64",
                analysis_duration=30,
            )
        ),
    )

    result = await sandbox.wait_for_report(task)
    if (report := result.get_long_report()) is not None:
        print(report.result.verdict)


asyncio.run(main())
```

!!! example "Usecase"

    This is useful when you just need to send a file for analysis with a minimum number of options.

## URL

In addition to checking files, it is possible to check URLs.

It is mainly used to download a file from a link and send it to the sandbox for further analysis.

```py title="Code example" hl_lines="16-24"
import asyncio

from ptsandbox import Sandbox, SandboxKey
from ptsandbox.models import SandboxOptions, SandboxScanURLTaskRequest


async def main():
    key = SandboxKey(

        )

        return await self.api.creat_url_scan(scan, read_timeout)
    ```

## Advanced scan

For example, we need to fine-tune the sample launch parameters, put additional files in the sandbox, etc.

This can be done with advanced scanning options.

```py title="Code example" hl_lines="17-25"
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path

from ptsandbox import Sandbox, SandboxKey
from ptsandbox.models import SandboxOptionsAdvanced


async def main():
    key = SandboxKey(
        name="test-key-1",
        key="<TOKEN_FROM_SANDBOX>",
        host="10.10.10.10",
    )

    sandbox = Sandbox(key)

    task = await sandbox.create_advanced_scan(
        Path("./example.elf"),
        extra_files=[Path("./file.txt"), Path("./file.sh")], # (1)!
        sandbox=SandboxOptionsAdvanced( # (2)!
            image_id="ubuntu-jammy-x64",
            analysis_duration=30,
            disable_clicker=True,
        ),
    )

    result = await sandbox.wait_for_report(task)
    if (report := result.get_long_report()) is not None:
        print(report.result.verdict)


asyncio.run(main())
```

1. The library does not check the existence of files
2. We specify `SandboxOptionsAdvanced` instead of `SandboxOptions`

    task = await sandbox.create_advanced_scan(
